  <h1> Winning Three concective championships:</h1>
    <p> Kobe Bryant team up with shaquille O'Neal and
      won three concective championships together. He got
      his first ring in the year of 1999-2000 season.In
      that season they won 65 games and only lost 15
       times. So they reahed the NBA finals and beat
       the India Pacers in a 4-2 series. The following
       year they went with a record of 56-26 and
       reached the finals again. They faced the
       Philadelphia 76ers and beat them in a 4-1 series.
       The Los Angeles Lakers kept on dominating the
       league as they went 58-24 and beat the New Jersey
       Nets in a 4-0 series. But sadly Kobe and shaq had
       to brake apart but luckly it was kobe staying.</p>
       <h2> Last two Rings:</h2>
       <P> The last two was the hardest for him because he
         didn't have shaq anymore and faced harder teams. But
         the good thing is that he only needed one all-star player
         to help him win a championship, not like
         others players. After reaching the finals
         in 2008 and loosing to the Boston Celtics,
         the fowwling year he came right back to the
         finals. But faced Orlando Magic and beat them
         in a 4-1 series and average 32 points per game.
         Next season he went straight to another NBA
         Championship but this time it was a rematch
         against the Boston celtics. This was the
         toughest of them all, which went to game seven.
         Lakers still ended winning the series in a 4-3 series
         and making that his 5th ring.According to Kobe the last
         one was the sweatest of them all because
         it was against their rivials and it was
         a revenge from the last time they met.</p>
